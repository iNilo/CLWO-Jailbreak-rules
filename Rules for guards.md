[*]Have a prisoner in sight at all times unless you are hunting or ordered by the warden. being in the main cell area is also fine.(if a staff member finds you in a position where you don't have a prisoner in sight and you are not trying to get one in sight they will slay you). (

[*]You cannot be in an area which requires you to pass through armory to leave.
