# Rules for prisoners

* Orders take effect where you stand. (when told to crouch walk follow warden don't jump first and then crouch walk, take 1 step out of your cell and freeze means not jumping first).

* Wait until warden has finished completing the order.

* Do not speak within the first minute.

* Last Requests that require staff must be accepted by 3 parties: the player itself, the warden and a staff member. (missing 1 of the 3 implies you don't get your LR)

* Prisoners must follow the orders given by the warden until 20 seconds after his death. (restrictions still apply).

* When given an order you try to complete it with the given restrictions. (do not go off the sand path,shift walk when crouch walking is restricted)

* When given an order which you cannot complete (not including restrictions) you have to freeze.

* You have to actively participate in (map-)minigames. (so you can't be just frozen and waiting).

* As a prisoner you are not allowed to inflict damage with map specific grenades/bombs to other prisoners unless in a minigame or special day

* If you are moved by the bomb explosion, do not move unless told to. (just freeze)

* If you ask for a repeat do not move. (in most cases, few exceptions exist)
