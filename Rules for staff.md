 [*]Give a freekiller the time to slay himself.

[*]Always slay in case of a free kill (If you are a regular member you can choose to slay the next round, but make sure you let staff know or use sm_slaynr).

[*]Do not use sm_say to alter the outcome of an last request. (you can only say I accept, or if no one is accepting hint towards another LR).

[*]Do not accept LR's if you are not going to type in the commands.

[*]Do not use sm_say unless you want to reach alive players or make an important point.

[*]Do not ignore any staff chat complaint by players.

[*]Do not check for rule knowledge by asking harder questions.

[*]Do not slay when plugin organises a vote.

[*]Any staff member can accept an LR for anyone, but must be capable of executing the commands. (if there is an immunity issue the person with higher immunity has to make sure the requested effects are applied to him/herself)

[*]Do not slay for warden not repeating, do not slay a guard killing a guy asking for a repeat, do not respawn someone that died when asking for a repeat. (learn to listen)

[*]When a free day is blocking shots by standing in front of guards or annoying guards by running close to their shots (in front of their screen),it's still a freekill but the prisoner does not get a respawn. (free killer has to slay)

[*]Friendly fire enabled events are allowed but keep them to a minimum (max 1, maybe 2 per map), preferably don't do it on +30 players. A staff member has to claim warden, explain very clearly what will happen, and ask if everyone understands (turn voice nuke on). if the friendly fire event is not done at minute 5:00 either slay all or turn beacons on, you must slay everyone before 3:00. (also explain you will slay at 3:00). A predefined price must be stated, so no LR's to the winners, they just get the predefined price (free day for them). [/list][font=Verdana]
