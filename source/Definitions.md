# Definitions

* Hunting: actively looking and not staying in 1 area (camping the tower,etc...).

* Freekill: if a guard kills a prisoner that was following all the given orders.

* Rebelling: rebelling is when a prisoner turns red breaks any prisoner rules or whenever a prisoner is not following order given by the warden.

* Walking: either shift/crouch walking (no jumping).

* Ghosting: Ghosting is an act of multiple players handing out information to each other which result in an unfair gaming experience.

* Baiting: being close enough to a prisoner that you can be killed by a zeus x2 range.

* Shift: Whatever button you press to walk which is not crouching.

* Free time: an area restricted "free-day" where prisoners can freely move in (including jumping) and must follow the given restrictions for this free-time. (you cannot leave the area, you do not need to listen to any commands until free-time is revoked).

* Skipping a game: Skipping a game means you cannot be killed for skipping the game and not be treated differently because of the skip. (in other words: if you skip hard slide, the warden cannot play some shitty game with you because you chose to skip the game)

* Stairs / ramp: Is the same thing.

* Hurting a guard: Anything that hurts a guard which isn't map related. [Map secrets are excluded]
