# Rules for off-duty guards.

* You are allowed to go anywhere you want, play any mini games, but secrets/vents/armoury are still restricted.

* When being attacked by a prisoner you may return fire to neutralize the threat. (this will not void the off-day)

* You may engage a rebelling prisoners but this will void your day off, meaning your beacon should be removed and you should be back with your other guards and following warden's orders.

* You are not forced to engage a rebelling prisoner. (even when red)
